# What-is-the-Nordic-political-economic?
## Code of a machine-learning-based study on Measuring Socialism Data Set

"Whether these Nordic countries are socialism or capitalism?"

"How much these Nordic are similar to each other and different to non-Nordic countries?"

"Which features play the more important roles on the “Nordic Model?”

This study tries to provide some insights from statistics perspectives by investigating the empirical evidence to help answer these questions. On this purpose, a bunch of variables, covering the areas of government taxation, spending, organizational resources, regulations, and programs, is analyzed here by using the unsupervised machine learning approaches to capture the underlying relationship. ***K-means clustering and Principal component analysis (PCA)*** are employed as the mian methods here.

## Data Collection
The data is collected from the “Measuring Socialism Data Set, version 1.0.” data set built and released by Cohen, Joseph Nathan and Joseph van der Naald(Cohen n.d.) in 2019, which aims to capture some dimensions of countries’ conformity to socialist or capitalist ideals. The data in this data set compiled from several databases, such as The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s and The World Bank’s, including country-level indicators and statistics data, and originally covering 41 countries and 243 variables from 2015 to 20171.
